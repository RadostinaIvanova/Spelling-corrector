# Spelling-corrector

The program corrects spelling mistakes in search queries -  words and phrases that people type into a search box in order to pull up a list of results.
It uses Demerau-Levenshtein edit distance between two sequences, moreover it uses weightened edit distance between two words using  a combination of single operations edits such as
insertion, deletion,transposition or substitution. It uses stochastic probability model for predictive modelling and probabilistic forecasting. Using both the model 
and weighted edit distance it generates candidates and chooses that with best probability.
